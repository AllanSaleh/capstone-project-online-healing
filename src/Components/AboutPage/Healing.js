        At Healing, wedd believe there is a better way to do things. A more
        valuable way where customers are earned rather than bought. We're
        obsessively passionate about it, and our mission is to help people
        achieve it. We focus on search engine optimization. It's one of the
        least understood and least transparent aspects of great marketing, and
        we see that as an opportunity. We're excited to simplify SEO for
        everyone through our software, education, and community.
