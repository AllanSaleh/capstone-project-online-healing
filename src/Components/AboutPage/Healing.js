        At Healing, wedd believe there is a better way to do things. A more valuable way where
        customers are earned rather than bought. We're obsessively passionate about it, and our
        mission is to help people achieve it. We focus on search engine optimization. It's one of
        the least understood and least transparent aspects of great marketing, and we see that as an
        opportunity. We're excited to simplify SEO for everyone through our software, education, and
        community.
